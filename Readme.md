# How to create a custom WinForms action type with a custom control (BarCheckItem), associated with it


This example demonstrates how to represent an action via BarCheckItem. For this purpose, a SimpleAction descendant ( [CheckableSimpleAction](CS/EFCore/CustomActionEF/CustomActionEF.Module/CheckableSimpleAction.cs) ) is implemented, because it is required to save the checked state of the action. To represent a custom action in a UI, the [BarCheckItemCheckableSimpleActionControl](CS/EFCore/CustomActionEF/CustomActionEF.Win/ActionControls/BarCheckItemCheckableSimpleActionControl.cs) is used. To bind an abstract action to its UI representation, a custom [CheckableSimpleActionBinding](CS/EFCore/CustomActionEF/CustomActionEF.Win/ActionControls/CheckableSimpleActionBinding.cs) is created. The binding operation is performed by [CustomActionControlController](CS/EFCore/CustomActionEF/CustomActionEF.Win/Controllers/CustomActionControlController.cs).

Note that in most cases, it is not required to implement a custom action and action item. It is sufficient to customize the existing action control as described in the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#Xaf/CustomDocument3183"><u>How to: Customize Controls Associated with an Action</u></a> topic.
